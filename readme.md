# NovaOS.py Example Implementation

Welcome to the example Implementation of NovaOS.py. NovaOS is a "operating system" that is designed to make it possible to write once, run anywhere.

`This is currently incomplete.`
This implementation is aimed at computers with python3 and pygame (but just uses Pygames framebuffer and events, should be feasible to swap out by writing a new driver and configuring it)
User passwords are "password" for both.
Loglevels:  0: Notice, 1: Error, 2: Devel, -1: None, at all, ever for some stupid reason
